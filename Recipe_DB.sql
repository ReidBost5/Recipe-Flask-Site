Ladle ¼ cup of pancake batter onto your hot griddle, or pan: measure out about ¼ cup of gluten-free pancake batter onto your hot oil-pan or electric griddle. Use the back of the measuring cup to help spread the batter some. 6. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles form around the edges. When the edges are golden brown and the bubbles are popping up through the center of the pancake, use your spatula and take a peak to see if they are brown to your liking. Then flip the gluten-free pancake and cook for another 5 minutes or so. Always check for doneness before you remove your pancake from the pan or griddle.', False, True);

Sprinkle a little more than 1/4 cup cheese on the tortilla, followed by some olives, avocado, and hot pepper sauce. Place another tortilla on top to make a sandwich. Cover the quesadilla with a lid. After one minute, flip the quesadilla. When the cheese has melted on the inside, remove the quesadilla. Repeat with remaining ingredients. 2.

VALUES('Fried Chicken', '1. In a large bowl, beat the eggs. In another bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika to make a seasoned salt. Add the flour to a third bowl. 2. Prepare the chicken by first seasoning each piece of chicken to your taste with the seasoned salt. Then dip each piece in the egg and drag through flour until coated well. 3. Fill a large pot or deep fryer half full with oil and heat to 350°F. Place the chicken parts in and fry until dark and crisp. The thighs and legs will take longer to cook – about 15 minutes – than the breast and wings, which will take about 10 minutes. 4. Remove from heat, let sit for 5 minutes to cool and enjoy!', False, False);

Whisk together the flour, baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. 3. Beat the butter and both sugars on medium-high speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer) until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs, one at time, beating after each addition to incorporate. Beat in the vanilla. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to medium, add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips. 4. Scoop 12 heaping tablespoons of dough about 2 inches apart onto each prepared baking sheet. Roll the dough into balls with slightly wet hands. Bake, rotating the cookie sheets from upper to lower racks halfway through, until golden but still soft in the center, 12 to 15 minutes (the longer the cook time, the crunchier the cookies). Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer to a rack to cool completely. 5. Let the baking sheets cool completely, scoop the remaining dough onto 1 sheet and bake. Store the cookies in a tightly sealed container at room temperature for up to 5 days.', False, False);
